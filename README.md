My first ETL pipeline using Python and Pandas
# Mini Data Engineer Project

This is a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project created using Python and Pandas in Google Colab.

## 🚀 What It Does:
- **Extract:** Reads a raw CSV file (`students.csv`)
- **Transform:** Cleans data by removing rows with missing values
- **Load:** Saves the cleaned data into a new CSV file (`students_cleaned.csv`)

## 🧰 Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## 📁 Files in this Project:
- `students.csv` - Original data file with some missing values
- `clean_data.ipynb` - Python notebook with ETL code
- `students_cleaned.csv` - Cleaned output (generated from code)
